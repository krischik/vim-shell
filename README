Many a time I find myself missing the power of
*the* editor while typing shell commands. This
script opens a new buffer which can be used to
enter shell commands. Commands will be
executed when you type <Enter>. Simply put, it
does a :r!command<cr> and a little more.

The global variable g:PROMPT wil be used as
the prompt string.
